- 👋 Hi, I'm @NoahVialle, some people know me as @darckus483, I'm from France and I'm learning web development.

- 🌱 I'm learning UE5 and improving my skills with blender. 
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on my main project project_unlimited but I'm always open to help if I can help. 
- 📫 How to reach me you can try linkdin but you're more likely to have your message end up in oblivion,
- so send me an email : main email but not my professional one email noah90v@gmail.com

- or on the main discord server of the unlimited project.
